This is the first project I did for python as a part of the Codedex Legend of Python course.

It's a game on a 5 by 5 tile map in the style of ZORG but with a twist. You're on limited time.
(I never played the original ZORG enough to know if that was a thing in that game too,
but I thought it was my idea first.)

Try not to die when time runs out.

Advice for the game:

- Watch out for easter eggs. Some are dangerous and others could save you.
- Try to explore as much as possible and don't miss anything.
- There's no carry limit!
- Be sure to check the HELP menu.

Hope you enjoy the game and there are more projects on the way...
